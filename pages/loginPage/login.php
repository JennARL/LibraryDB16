            Modification Details: Changed naming conventions of files and file structure, meaning updates needed for links.
        Date Modified: 2022_04_03 by Nathan Brueckner
            Modification Details: Added PHP logic to direct the user to the appropriate page based on session variables.
        Date Modified: 2022_04_05 by Nathan Brueckner
            Modification Details: Added Ajax POST method to send login form info to loginLogic.php, where the information is processed.
                Based on this processing, the user will be directed to loginDecision.php if a login matches, then will be directed to either the admin portal or the user portal.
        Date Modified: 2022_04_06 by Nathan Brueckner
            Modification Details: Removed Ajax POST method because of errors with jQuery - Changed to basic HTML post method, posting to loginLogic.php.
                Page direction is no longer handled by login.php unless user is already logged in.

            Modification Details: Changed session logic at the beginning from header redirection method to javascript injection to redirect page. Header wasn't working.
                Note: I think the header doesn't work because of the notation at the top here. Header doesn't work when there is any output before its called.

            Modification Details: Changed session logic back to header redirection method because I found that HTML comments before the file were the reason they were failing.

            Modification Details: Changed header to call from header.php
        Purpose of file:
            Login page, which will direct to either the staff/admin page or the student/faculty page.
